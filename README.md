# Gitlab-CI-CD-pipeline-notebooks
This repository is a collection of Gitlab CI/CD pipeline related notebooks to help developers get started to create a CI/CD pipeline using Gitlab. The notebooks are designed in such a way that beginners can start from scratch understanding the basics to automating the deployment process.

# Introduction

Gitlab CI CD pipeline is the most commonly used pipeline in the development community. It helps developers to concentrate only on developing the application and after that taking from Build process to Deployment everything is taken care by the pipeline.

# What is Gitlab & CI CD pipeline?

Instead of taking Wiki definition, in layman terms Gitlab is a DevOps tool which just like GitHub provides version control, issue-tracking etc. for your projects and along with it is also a great tool to solve the DevOps need for your projects.

CI CD is a term used for software development lifecycle which is a combination of multiple practices starting from writing your code to deploying it.

Overall, Gitlab provides developers to solve their DevOps needs by automating the process from Build to Deployment by creating a CI/CD pipeline which is easily achievable using Gitlab.

Deployment can be done through a server(Virtual machine) or through Docker images deployed on Kubernetes or using different cloud services.

The notebooks are created based on how the deployment is done whether it is done on just a machine from Gitlab or it is first dockerised and then deployed.
